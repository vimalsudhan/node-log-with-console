Its simple to use, as it overrides [console](https://nodejs.org/api/console.html) methods but adds more helpful details to the log lines like datetimestamp, file name with line of execution, etc. Template/Pattern in the generated log lines are configurable using (setPattern)[#configuring-pattern] method.

## Example
```js
const logger=require("./index.js");

console.info("This is an info");
console.error("this is an error",new Error("Error occurred"));

```

```sh
